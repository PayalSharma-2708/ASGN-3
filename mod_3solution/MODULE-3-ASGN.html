	     	                  Introvert is someone who prefers calm, minimally stimulating environments. Introverts tend to feel drained after socializing and regain their energy by spending time alone.They sare someone who gets drained by socializing and recharges by being alone. But there’s so much more to introversion than that.Everyone is born with an innate temperament — a way that you gain energy and prefer to interact with the world. Introversion and extroversion are temperaments. Whether you’re an introvert or extrovert is largely determined by your genes — meaning you were probably born that way.However, we’re also shaped by our life experiences. If your quiet, thoughtful ways were encouraged by your parents, teachers, and others, you probably grew up feeling confident in who you are. But, like many introverts, if you were teased, bullied, or told to “come out of your shell,” you may have developed social anxiety or felt like you had to pretend to be someone you’re not.Sooner or later, however, all introverts will experience the dreaded “introvert hangover,” which is the feeling of being completely wiped out from too much “people time” or stimulation. This can mean feeling fatigued, unable to concentrate, or even grouchy.While introverts are more likely to internalize problems and think through them, It’s as if your brain has used up all its mental energy and just doesn’t haven’t any left.

	     		              Ambiversion is related to introversion and extroversion, the two different “temperaments” that people can have. A lot of us talk about these two traits as if they are either/or — you have to be one or the other. But that’s not quite right. The truth is that introversion and extroversion are on a spectrum, and nobody is 100% one or the other. Not even the quietest introvert or the chattiest extrovertAmbiversion is a relatively recent term, but a growing number of people identify with it. It’s hard to say how many people are ambiverts. Psychologist Carl Jung didn’t use the exact term “ambivert,” but he believed that people who are neither highly introverted nor highly extroverted are in the majority. Some recent experts make a similar claim, suggesting that two thirds of all people are ambiverts.Ambiverts, like every temperament, have their own set of strengths that’s hard for other people to match. One of the core ambivert traits is adaptability, and that comes out in many of the ways ambiverts interact with the world. Because ambiverts are so adaptable, they can thrive in a variety of careers. However, there are some positions where ambiverts truly shine, and even outperform other.Generally ambivert means a person whose personality is between introvert and extrovert.In Many situations they behave like introvert and in many like extrovert.
